# AES_implementation

To execute my implementation of AES: python aes.py
	From the terminal you can choose:
		-To encrypt a file or a string
		-The lenght of the key (128/192/256)
		-The mode of operation (ECB/CBC/CFB/OFB/CTR)
		-To see the output on the terminal, to print it on i file or not to see it
[NOTE: The program seems stuck if tested with the 10MB file, but it's just really slow]

To execute the real world implementation of AES: python real_world_aes.py:
	It will automatically test the 5 modes of operation on the 3 test files of 1KB, 100kb and 10MB 
	It will print the running times on the terminal
